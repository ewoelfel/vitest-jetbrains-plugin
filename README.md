# How Vitest Runner plugin resolves working directory?
          
* If `workspaces` declared in `package.json`, and working directory is package's directory.
* Vitest Runner will resolve proximate `package.json` for Vitest tested file, and working directory may be project's root directory or subdirectory of subproject.
                
**Attention**: for mono repository with subprojects independent, working directory will be subproject's directory, 
and Vitest Runner will use `vite.config.js` inside subproject. 

# Vitest debug support

* How about `--coverage` support? Please add `c8` dependency in package.json and reopen the project.

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
   "c8": "^7.12.0"
  }
}
```

# Attention

This plugin just a temp solution before official Vitest support from WebStorm.
I think JetBrains people will do this job, and they know Vitest is great framework.
For Vitest support in WebStorm, please vote here: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-54437

# Vitest global support

Please enable `globals: true` for `test` in Vitest configuration file.

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import {defineConfig} from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
    test: {
        globals: true,
    },
})
```
          
**Exclude jest**: jest is removed from the devDependencies, anyway, jest still resolved and installed by co dependency during `npm install`. 
You can use following solution to exclude jest: 

```
"scripts": {
    "postinstall": "rm -rf node_modules/jest*; rm -rf node_modules/@jest"
}
```

**Attention**: Please reload(close/open) project if you enable `globals: true` first time.
